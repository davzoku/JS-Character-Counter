# JS-Character-Counter
Using javascript to collect user input, splits input into characters and count character repetitions in Console. Emoji, unicode friendly. 👍

Meant for analysing character analysis for lyrics in chinese songs. Possibly for future NLTK uses.

Note:
- Every white spaces, punctuation symbols will be counted.
- Emoji would not be splitted into its indecipherable unicode components.
